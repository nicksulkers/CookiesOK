### Browser specific adjustments
Before you do so, there is one adjustment to make before you can start last step to take. Different browsers require slightly different manifest.json files. 3 versions have been included in this project.

If you use Firefox, rename "manifest.firefox.json" to "manifest.json"

If you use Edge, rename "manifest.edge.json" to "manifest.json"

If you use either Chrome or Opera, rename "manifest.chrome-opera.json" to "manifest.json"
